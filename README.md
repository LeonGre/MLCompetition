how to make a Prediction:
- start the collaborative filtering model in predictions.py, by commenting out the model you want to use, to first calculate the predictions of this model
- start the Models/ensemble_predictions.py to ensemble it with another Regressor model
- you can find the final predictions in Models/final_predictions.csv
